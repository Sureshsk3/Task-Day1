1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Computers and servers communicate with one other by sending and receiving data via HTTP. 
Resources are loaded sequentially via HTTP/1.1; hence, in the event that one resource fails to load, all subsequent resources are blocked. 
On the other hand, HTTP/2 allows many streams of data to be sent simultaneously over a single TCP connection, preventing any one resource from blocking another. 
In order for the client to identify which stream each binary message belongs to, HTTP/2 divides data into binary-code messages and numbers these messages.
HTTP/2 removes unnecessary information from HTTP header packets using a more sophisticated compression technique called HPACK.

2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each.
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
of primitive or reference types, in the form of key value pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
